# Hey You thanks for visit my App. That app was made on course The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Feel free to copy, or fork and use my code!

In that app I used additional dependencies like:
-react-parallax-tilt
-react-tsparticles
-tsparticles
-tachyons
